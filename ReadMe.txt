A simple demo for showing the application of Genetic Algorithm in real-time 3D game

Assume there is a soldier equipting a shield. He needs to avoid laser damage by controlling his body 
	and the shield(which can block the lasers).

To simplify the problem, assume this soldier can only rotate his body around y axis. But his shouder 
	joint and elbow joint can rotate around x, y, and z axes with human-like limitations.

To test:
	1. Load this folder as a Unity 3D project (Recomand version: 2018.4.14f1)
	2. Run the scene
	3. Input parameters to create lasers
	4. Set the parameters  for Genetic Algorithm to generate AI reaction
	5. The results are updated on screen in real-time

	* Left button and scroll of mouse can be used to adjust view direction.
